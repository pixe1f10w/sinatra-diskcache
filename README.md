# Sinatra-DiskCache [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/sinatra-diskcache.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/sinatra-diskcache)

Allows to cache heavy-load query results on the disk.

## Depends on

Nope. It doesn't have any dependencies.

## Install

    gem install sinatra-diskcache

## Usage

Oh, it's pretty easy and straightforward. Look, I'll show you.

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'sinatra/diskcache'

# ... something clever here ...

get '/something' do
    result = diskcache 'somefile' do |file| # this block will be invoked only in case of absence of 'somefile'
        f = File.open file, 'w'

        # heavy load here
        sleep 5

        f.write 'something to be cached'
        f.close
    end

    send_file result # or transfer it anyhow else
end
```

Basically, that's all. For more detailed example you can look [here](https://github.com/pixe1f10w/scalls/).
